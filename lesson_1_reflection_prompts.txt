How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to find the mispelling of the word 'space'

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can easily go back to a previous version before a problem started
    You can quickly change direction in problem solving withou having
    to rebuild from scratch

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro is that you can make logical commits that make sense auto saving is more like Disaster recovery

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because it is useful to see the changes in multiple files that may be needed to make a change like in an android program or any program that erquires multiple files to run

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can use git log to look at the different commits and their ID's
    You can use git diff to see the differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You have the possibility to experiment and if you royally break something you can go back to a previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To find the meaning of life one commit at a time
