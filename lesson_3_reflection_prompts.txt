When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  all of the time, at least it is a source of backup in case you lose your drive!!
  
  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  
  Bcause you might be working on something remote you do not want pushed yet
