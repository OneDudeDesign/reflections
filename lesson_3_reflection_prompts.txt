When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  all of the time, at least it is a source of backup in case you lose your drive!!
  
  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  
  Because you might be working on something remote you do not want pushed yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?


  fork is a replica of someone elses repository copied so you have permission, a clone is downloading a clone of a repository to your remote and a branch is a split from the main code line to possible work on features or collaborate.
  
  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  
    In case there are conflicting changes made at the same time
